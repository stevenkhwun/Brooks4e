Python Guide to Introductory Econometrics for Finance by Chris Brooks

**IMPORTANT: This repository is still under construction and the contents are not complete and may not be accurate.**

This repository contains my works on the book Python Guide to Introductory Econometrics for Finance (4th ed.) by Chris Brooks.

Basically, it is a replication of the book. However, since some functions mentioned in the Python Guide had been depreciated, similar functions available in other libraries (if available) are used instead.

The Jupyter Notebooks are arranged in the same sequence of the Guide. However, some shorter chapters may be consolidated into one chapter.

The Jupyter Notebooks are commented as concise as possible.
